I am a fifth-year PhD student in Deparment of Mathematics, University of Utah. My advisors are [Yekaterina Epshteyn](http://www.math.utah.edu/~epshteyn/) and [Akil Narayan](http://www.sci.utah.edu/~akil/). I am interested in developing structure-preserving numerical methods for hyperbolic systems of conservation laws with uncertainty. I am also interested in machine learning and deep learning. Here is my [CV](https://dihandai.github.io/files/CV.pdf).

[Here](https://dihandai.github.io/wb1-2-ten.mp4) is a video shows how the uncertainty in the shallow water system propogate as time changes. The numerical example is taken from this [poster](https://dihandai.github.io/files/ICERMPoster_Dihan-Dai.pdf).
